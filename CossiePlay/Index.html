<br>
We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about: this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.<br>
First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry<br>
If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume.<br>
Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you’ve been to CossiePlay!<br>

<h2>About Us
</h2>
<p>
CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.<br>
We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.

<br>
On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).<br>
