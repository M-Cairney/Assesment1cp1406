<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Mitchell Cairney</p>
<p><strong>Login: jc260799</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is to improve the customer base for CossiePlay and get a younger audience involved in the Cosplay and parties. This will benifit the client as they will have more orders coming in, improving the overall outcome of the company, and appealing to a younger demographic.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluation of the Goals set can be made by compairing the amount of inquires made before the implementation of the website to after. This may also take into account the number of people booking in for the party and also the number of people who show up to the monthly party's. We know that around 30 people show up for the regular party's and about 4 costumes are ordered per week, the client wishes to get these numbers higher so we can measure these as a measure of the success of the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website will be a younger demographic (12-30) as this is what the client has stated in there description of the website they would like. As most of the clients customer base is between the ages of 35-50 this site should be aimed at bringing in the younger generation to get them involved in Cosplay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To specifically target this audience we will design the website to have a modern simple look as the younger generation does not really like to read into things, so we will need to keep the paragraphs to a small minimal &nbsp;setting and keeping everything brief and simple, this will help the target audience get there information quicker and and keep them interested enough to come to the party or order a costume </p>
